        <h2>Heading</h2>
        <p>Today is a sacred day, a holy day, a day that will long be remembered in the records kept in heaven and by the saints of God here in the Democratic Republic of Congo. 
            We know that angels often have the opportunity to rejoice with us on earth during major events. Sometimes they join us in singing our praises to God. Of course, 
            we have heard a heavenly choir today and I do not hesitate to say that angels rejoice with us as we begin the construction of a house of the Lord.
        </p> 
        <P>The construction of a holy temple takes place only when the Lord reveals to His prophet that there are a righteous people prepared and ready for its sacred purposes. The building of this temple means that the restored kingdom of God will be established here in Kinshasa and throughout the Democratic Republic of Congo until the Lord returns to the earth, and that there will be a covenant people here to receive Him when He returns. This holy house will also bless the country and people who surround it whether or not they are members of the Church. It will be a light upon a hill, and the glory of the Lord will be upon it. 
        <P>The people of Africa and of the Democratic Republic of Congo are a special people. They trust in God and they pray to Him. Our Heavenly Father loves His sons and daughters here, and answers their prayers..</p>
